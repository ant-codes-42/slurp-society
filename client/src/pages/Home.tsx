            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p className= "home-description">Here at Slurp Society we value quality and community. Made in house every day, our ramen noodles have become renown as some of the best in the twin cities.
                Our chefs Anthony, Vincent, Lindsey, and Tristan work tirelessly ever day to produce quality ramen bowls that are sure to bring your family together at our beautiful 
                restaurant. When you come to Slurp Society, you know what to expect; a wonderful, calming and inviting aesthetic with quality, consistent service. We don't stop at the food. We want to give
                back. It is imperitave to us to help feed not only our paying customers, but also those less fortunate. That is why we partner with several charity orginizations that allow us to host pop up
                food kitchens in impovershed areas around the United States, and hopefully soon, around the world. 

                    Hopefully we'll see you soon! We're excited to serve you! Welcome to the Slurp Society!
