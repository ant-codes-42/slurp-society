# Slurp-Society

## Description

The Slurp Society project was created to solve the complex nature many resturant owners face of providing an intuitive easy to use website that allows users to
register, login, navigate through the website, make a reservation, and recieve confirmation that their reservation has been secured. This aims to reduce that complexity
by using an API (Resend API) that provides instant feedback when a user submits a request for a reservation, a React Calendar that assists in providing a physical representation
of what dates and number of seats are available. This project was built as a means of reinforcing our skills as developers. In creating this project we implemented an API that assists
in sending data to the user, intergrated a database that will store and retrieve user login data, and reservation data. This project means to simplify the relationship between restaurants
and their patrons. It provides an intuitive interface that will allow users to navigate availability within a restaurant's open reservations through registering with the restaurant.
Slurp Society has strengthened all the skills to necessary to integrate a system like this including creating a database with postSQL and sequalize, using an API to send confirmation emails, requiring authentication through JWT, and making a full stack React application.
